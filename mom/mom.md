# Doubt Clearing Session (MOM)
---

## 1. MVC Architecture

MVC stands for **Model - View - Controller**. It's a way of organizing backend code so that each part has one clear job, instead of everything being dumped into a single file.

| Part           | Job                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Model**      | Talks to the database - defines what the data looks like and how it's stored/fetched                         |
| **View**       | The response format sent back (in an API, this is usually just JSON, not an HTML page)                       |
| **Controller** | Contains the actual logic - decides what to do when a request comes in, and calls the Model to get/save data |
| **Route**      | Decides which URL maps to which controller function                                                          |

**Why separate them?** If everything is written in one file, the code becomes hard to read, hard to debug, and hard to change later. By splitting responsibilities, I can change how data is stored (Model) without touching how requests are handled (Controller), and vice versa. This is the same pattern I already used in my `resume-api` project (34 routes, MVC/controller pattern).

## 2. Backend and APIs

An **API** is basically a way for two programs to talk to each other - my frontend sends a **request**, my backend processes it and sends back a **response**.

- **Request:** What the client sends - includes the URL, the method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and sometimes a body (data being sent, like a form).
- **Response:** What the server sends back - includes a status code and usually a body in **JSON** format.
- **Status Codes:** Numbers that tell you what happened with the request:
  - `200` - OK, success
  - `201` - Created (something new was added)
  - `400` - Bad Request (client sent something wrong)
  - `401` / `403` - Not allowed/unauthorized
  - `404` - Not Found
  - `500` - Server Error (something broke on the backend)
- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** The standard format data is sent in - basically key-value pairs, easy for both humans and machines to read.
- **Why Postman:** Postman lets me test my API endpoints (send requests, check responses) without needing a frontend built yet. It's how I can confirm my backend logic works correctly before connecting any UI to it.

## 3. JavaScript - Basics to Array Methods

We revisited JS fundamentals and moved up to array methods, since these come up constantly in both frontend and backend code.

**Basics revisited:** variables (`let`/`const`), functions, conditionals, loops, and how JS handles data types.

**Array methods** - these let me transform arrays without writing manual loops every time:

| Method      | What it does                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `map()`     | Transforms every item in an array and returns a new array     |
| `filter()`  | Returns a new array with only the items that pass a condition |
| `reduce()`  | Combines all items into a single value (like a sum or total)  |
| `find()`    | Returns the first item that matches a condition               |
| `forEach()` | Runs a function on every item, without returning a new array  |

These are used all the time in backend code too - like transforming database results before sending them as a JSON response.

## 4. Error Handling

In backend code, things can go wrong - bad input, database failure, etc. Error handling means catching these problems instead of letting the app crash.

```javascript
try {
  // code that might fail
} catch (error) {
  // handle the error here
  res.status(500).json({ message: "Something went wrong" });
}
```

- `try` block: the code that might throw an error.
- `catch` block: runs only if something inside `try` fails - this is where I handle it gracefully instead of crashing.
- **Sending the right status code matters** - if I always send `200` even on errors, the client (frontend) has no way to know something actually failed. The status code should always match what really happened (e.g., `400` for bad input, `500` for server-side failure).

---

## 5. Git and GitHub

Revisited the core workflow:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push
```

- `git add .` - stages my changes (tells Git which files to include in the next commit).
- `git commit -m "..."` - saves a snapshot of those changes with a message describing what changed.
- `git push` - sends my committed changes to GitHub (the remote repository).

**Writing real commit messages** - instead of vague messages like "update" or "fix", a good commit message says what actually changed and why, like `"fix: resolve nested repo issue in resume-api"`. This makes it much easier to look back at project history later - something I've already dealt with in my `resume-api` project (nested repos, merge conflicts, force pushes).

_(Branching workflow to be planned/covered later.)_

## Key Takeaways

- MVC keeps backend code organized by giving each part - Model, View, Controller, Route - one clear responsibility.
- APIs work on a request → response cycle, and status codes tell the client what actually happened.
- Postman is for testing backend endpoints independently, before a frontend exists.
- Array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `find`, `forEach`) replace manual loops for common data transformations.
- Proper error handling (`try`/`catch` + correct status codes) prevents silent failures and helps the frontend respond correctly.
- Clear Git commit messages make project history readable and easier to explain later - important for both teamwork and interviews.
